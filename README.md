# Heart disease prediction system

## Overview

  - This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease in patients using machine learning techniques.
  - The code is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (heart_disease_prediction.ipynb).
  - It utilizes Python and popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.
  - The dataset used for training and testing the model is included (heart.csv).
  - The notebook provides comprehensive data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values and feature scaling.
  - Various machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, are employed for prediction.
  - The notebook utilizes model evaluation metrics, such as accuracy and F1 score, to assess the performance of the models.
  - Data visualization techniques are incorporated to gain insights into the dataset and understand the relationships between features.
  - Detailed explanations and comments are included throughout the notebook to enhance code understanding.
